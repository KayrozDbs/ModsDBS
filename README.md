MODS

This repo serves to house mods for DBS. Please see example_mod.js to see how modding works in DBS. DBS does not hold responsibility for the content and effects of 3rd party mods you install.

To install mods:

Download this repository by pressing "Code" then "Download ZIP" on the repo home page. download

Locate the javascript (.js) file for the mod(s) you want to add inside the mods folder of this repo.

Copy that file(s).

Open the BotFiles folder for the bot you want to add the mods to. This folder will be located in the location you chose to create the bot in.

Paste the js files inside the "mods" folder inside BotFiles (/BotFiles/mods).

Now open DBS (restart it if it was open already), and you will now be able to add responses of the type of mod(s) you added, just like any other response in DBS.

Done!
